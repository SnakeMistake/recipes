            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Set oven to 440 degrees</li>
                <li>Coat a metal cookie sheet with 2-3 tbsp of cornmeal, spread evenly.  Drizzle with olive oil.</li>
                <li>Stretch pizza dough with hands into a disc-like shape.  Handle carefully so as not to rip the dough.  Gradually work the disc wider until it resembles the shape of the cookie sheet.  Place it down and work it as far out to the edges as you can get it without ripping the dough.</li>
                <li>Pre-cook any wet ingredients such as peppers, mushrooms, etc.  Water in the toppings can make the dough cook unevenly and it's good (but not necessary) to cook some off now</li>
                <li><em>Recommended: </em>Cook some mushrooms in garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Deglaze with a dash of wine.  Mix this in with the sauce/toppings in the following step.</li>
                <li>Spread sauce (red or pesto) as close to the edge of the crust as possible.  Spread out any desired toppings.  Rip the mozzarella ball into marble-sized pieces and spread evenly across the pizza.</li>
                <li>Put the pizza in the oven for 10-15 minutes.  Remove when the cheese begins to brown and the crust looks golden and crisp.</li>
                <li>Grate hard cheeses (parmegiano reggiano or pecorino romano or both) using a microplane.  Spread generously on the pizza after it has left the oven.  Let sit for 3-5 minutes, slide and serve.</li>
